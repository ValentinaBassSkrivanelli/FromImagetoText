# FromImagetoText
Convert your image to text

Image to Text Converter with Python and Tesseract OCR This project is a simple implementation of an image-to-text converter using Python, the Pillow Library (PIL) for image handling, and Tesseract OCR for optical character recognition (OCR).

How it Works: Image loading: PIL is used to open the image containing the text.

OCR Processing: Tesseract OCR is used to extract the text from the image.

Text Output: The result is printed to the console, displaying the extracted text.

Requirements: Python installed on the system.

Tesseract OCR installed (path configured in the script).

Required libraries: Pillow and pytesseract.

Applications: Document and image scanning.

Conversion of printed text to digital format.

Automated image processing with text.

This project can be extended by adding image preprocessing (binarization, noise removal, contrast adjustment) or exporting the extracted text to a file.
